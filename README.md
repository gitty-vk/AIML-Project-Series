I completed three projects during my internship at NEXUS, which significantly enhanced my learning and allowed me to apply acquired skills effectively.
Project 1: Simple Chatbot
Developed a Python-based chatbot capable of answering fundamental questions. The project leverages Python to create an interactive conversational agent that responds to user queries.
Project 2: Admission Query Chatbot
Implemented a Python-based chatbot using relevant libraries to address inquiries related to VIT AP University admissions. The chatbot provides essential information and demonstrates basic functionality.
Project 3: Heart Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning
Utilized Python and its machine learning libraries to build a predictive model for detecting heart diseases. The project involved dataset analysis, model training, and was executed in a Google Colaboratory environment for seamless collaboration and execution.
